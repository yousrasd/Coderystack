Welcome to the second part of the Kotlin tutorial series! ðŸ‘‹ In this tutorial, we will learn about Kotlin syntax, dive into variables 
and data types and cover control flow and functions.

Let's get started!

&nbsp;

## Basic Kotlin Structure
Every Kotlin program starts with a **main** function. Think of it as the main door of a house; just like we need to open the door to enter
a house, the programs begins by entering the main function.

This main function is the starting point for every Kotlin program. All program logic must either reside in or be initiated from here.

If we look at the first code that your wrote in the previous tutorial, 
```java title="HelloWorld.kt"
fun main() {
    println("Hello World!")
}
```

This the the main function. The Kotlin Interpreter looks for this function and starts program execution from here.

## Kotlin Variables

A variable is a placeholder for data that may either remain constant or change over time. Once declared, we can reassign a mutable variable to a new value as many times as needed.

To declare a mutable (changeable) variable in Kotlin, we use the **var** keyword:

```java title="VariableDeclarationVar.kt"
var color = "blue"
```


In contrast, to declare an immutable (unchangeable) variable, we use the **val** keyword. This data cannot change after it's assigned.

```java title="VariableDeclarationVal.kt"
val color = "green"
```

With **val**, we can only use the assignment (=) operator once. 
Attempting to assign a new value to a val variable will result in a compile-time error (an error that occurs during code compilation).

### Variables - Null assignment

Both mutable and immutable variables can be assigned a **null** value, representing an absence of data or a "non-existent" value.

```java title="VariableDeclarationVal.kt"
var color: String? = null
val month: String? = null
```

Note: In Kotlin, variables need to be explicitly marked as nullable (using ? after the type) to hold a null value. 
Otherwise, a non-nullable variable will cause a compile-time error if you try to assign null to it.

## Kotlin Data types

Kotlin defines couple of data types that can be used to express the types of variables.

We can define numbers whether whole or with decimal points, booleans, characters, strings and arrays.

### Numbers

Numbers in Kotlin can either be **whole numbers** or **floating-point numbers**.

- To express a whole number, we can use **Byte**, **Short**, **Int**, or **Long**.
- To represent a floating-point number, we use **Float** or **Double**.


#### Byte
Byte is used to resentent a single whole digit number that ranges from <span>**-128**</span> to <span>**127**</span>.

```kotlin title="ByteDataType.kt"
val byteNumber: Byte = 100

```


#### Short
Short holds larger whole numbers than Byte. It occupies 16 bits and has a range of 
<span>**-32,768**</span> to <span>**32,767**</span>.

Example:

```kotlin title="ShortDataType.kt"
val shortValue: Short = 30000
```

#### Int
Int is the most commonly used data type for whole numbers. It is 32 bits and can represent values 
from <span>**-2,147,483,648**</span> to <span>**2,147,483,647**</span>.

Example:

```kotlin title="IntDataType.kt"
val intValue: Int = 2_000_000
```


#### Long
Long is used for extremely large whole numbers. It is 64 bits and supports values ranging from 
<span>**-9,223,372,036,854,775,808**</span> to <span>**9,223,372,036,854,775,807**</span>.
When using Long, the number must end with an L.

Example:

```kotlin title="LongDataType.kt"
val longValue: Long = 9_223_372_036_854_775_807L
```


#### Float
Float is used for floating-point numbers and occupies 32 bits.
It provides precision for up to 7 significant decimal digits and is typically used when memory is a concern.
To define a Float, append F to the value.

Example:
```kotlin title="FloatDataType.kt"
val floatValue: Float = 3.14F
```

#### Double
Double is the default for floating-point numbers and occupies 64 bits.
It provides precision for up to 15â€“16 significant decimal digits and is ideal for precise calculations.

Example:
```kotlin title="DoubleDataType.kt"
val doubleValue: Double = 2.718281828459045
```

<br/>
**Note:** Inserting a number outside the range of a specific type results in a compile-time error. 
For example, trying to assign a number larger than 127 to a Byte variable will produce a compile-time error.

### Booleans
Booleans are used to represent logical values, typically true or false.   

For example:

```kotlin title="BooleanDataType.kt"
val isKotlinFun: Boolean = true
val isOlderThan18: Boolean = false
```

<br/>
<br/>

### Characters
Characters are used to represent a single digit number or letter or special character. 

For example:

```kotlin title="CharacterDataType.kt"
val letter = "a"
```

<br/>
<br/>

### Strings
Strings are used to represent a sequence of characters, which can include letters, digits and special characters. 

For example:
```kotlin title="StringDataType.kt"
val color = "blue"
val orderNumber = "5"
```

<br/>

### Arrays
Arrays are a data structure used to store multiple variables within a single variable.
